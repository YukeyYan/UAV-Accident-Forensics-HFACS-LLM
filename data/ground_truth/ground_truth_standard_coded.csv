The UAS pilot engaged the autopilot's Return to Launch (RTL) mode, but the aircraft maintained cruise altitude during the landing sequence, contributing to the altitude conflict. No evidence suggests physical impairment or fatigue of the pilot. The incident highlights potential technological environment issues with autopilot altitude management and possible team coordination gaps between UAS and manned aircraft operators.

The pilot believed that submitting the online waiver form granted immediate permission, whereas actual authorization can take up to 90 days. This reflects decision-making errors and violations at the individual level. There is no direct evidence of physical state impairments such as fatigue or stress. Technological environment factors are not implicated since the issue was procedural and knowledge-based rather than equipment failure.

The pilot was aware of airport operations and traffic patterns and took care to avoid conflicts. However, helicopter traffic was operating in right traffic pattern over the same area at 500 feet AGL, while the drone was under 100 feet AGL. No direct conflict or violation of Part 107.37 or 107.43 was reported, but concerns about safety were raised by the helicopter company. The analysis finds no clear evidence of pilot physical impairment or technological failures. Organizational and supervisory factors related to coordination and communication between manned and unmanned operations, as well as formal notification procedures (NOTAM), are relevant.

However, the TFR was not actually activated, leading to an airborne conflict with manned aircraft inside the supposed restricted area.

The operator did not observe any air traffic and only realized the airspace violation after post-flight review. The operator has since taken corrective action by submitting an airspace authorization request before future flights in the area.
