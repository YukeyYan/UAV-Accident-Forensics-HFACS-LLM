The test points were completed and we were building time on the aircraft.  We were in preprogramming mode; where the aircraft flies along predetermined waypoints.  When the last waypoint is reached; the aircraft reenters the first waypoint and flies another lap of the preprogram waypoints.  Around XA00; we had been flying the preprogramed mission for about an hour with no issues.  There is a two person crew.  The left seat is the pilot seat and the right seat is a sensor operator who operates the payload.  The sensor operator was reading a regulatory document; when I decided I wanted to move the payload.  When we fly overseas; the pilot will occasionally cover both the left seat and the right seat when the sensor operator steps out for a few minutes to use the bathroom or get meals for the aircrew.  I had a lapse in judgment and didn't think that this could be an issue when flying at home in public use airspace.  In certain instances UAV's are flown with only one aircrew member; but this was not authorized on this flight.  I switched seats with the sensor operator in the right seat for several seconds and moved the payload.  The sensor operator sat down in the left seat.  I then stood up to move back to the left seat when another pilot stepped in the ground control station (cockpit) and took over the left seat.  The flight was finished without incident; however in hindsight I should not have switched seats with a non-pilot which is unauthorized.  I need to break out of my single pilot mindset whenever a two person crew is required and focus only on flying the aircraft.  Even when flying in preprogram mode the pilot needs to remain vigilant and ready to react to any traffic advisory or emergency.",,,,"A UAV pilot reported that he allowed a non qualified person to sit in the left pilot seat during a mission on which a qualified pilot and sensor operator were required in both of their respective seats.",

The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) program; as well as all remote programs; are growing exponentially. The military; and soon to be private sector; are pushing hard to get as many flights a day airborne as possible to further their testing of these aircraft. The FAA's position is cautionary as controllers attention shouldn't be distracted by flights above FL450. While they often use restricted airspace for testing; some of the recent flight plans are expansive and are completely outside Special Use (SUA) airspace. This will bring an increasing workload on the controllers and the National Airspace System (NAS). Confining them to SUA airspace and only allowing transit to and from is something the FAA will need to consider as flights per day increase. The other option is to create ultra ultra high sectors to deal with UAS aircraft. The military doesn't understand how the rules and regulations apply to UAS aircraft. Quite simply; they think they don't need to 'play' by the same rules since they are the only ones 'up there.' Next generation aircraft; private sector UAS; and military programs will all be vying for this newly accessible airspace. This report pertains to the massive amount of data to file flight plans for these UAS aircraft; and the lack of proper flight planning and deconfliction by the military for these flights which create several concerns on every flight.

While designing the mission I mistakenly allowed the first waypoint of that mission to be left at its default altitude of 6;000 MSL. After giving the aircraft autopilot the instruction to fly the mission I immediately noticed its decreasing altitude. I immediately disabled the autopilot resulting in only a minimal altitude loss. I corrected the design of the operational mission; and thought that I sent it to the aircraft. However during that time I became distracted with a handover brief to another pilot. Before getting out of the seat to handover to the Relief Pilot I activated pre-program for the autopilot again.

This amended right hand traffic pattern not only offered a larger safety margin; but allowed terrain separation as well; which is why a left hand traffic pattern was not utilized.While executing practice approaches; the aircrew noticed that the autopilot was not intercepting and maintaining the approach localizer/azimuth as briefed. The aircrew felt that the amended traffic pattern could be root cause of the lackluster performance and by widening and squaring the pattern; it could assist the autoland to regaining desired tracking performance. While flying the wider pattern; the aircrew was completely aware that they were operating extremely close to the airspace boundary; but felt they were still operating the landing pattern safely inside the restricted airspace.

The UAV's autopilot expectantly switched waypoint tracking logic which contributed to the UAV to penetrate outside its assigned SUA momentarily. The UAV operators were expecting the autopilot to continue to fly straight ahead; make a slight right turn; enter the right downwind on a 45; and initiate the pattern approaches as commanded. The basic autopilot logic will command the UAV to turn the shortest direction to the commanded waypoint in relation to UAV position/heading. As the UAV approached overhead to the recovery site; the UAV's autopilot logic un-expectantly switched from tracking to the commanded waypoint (downwind-to-base) skipped the base-to-final waypoint and began tracking the upwind-to-crosswind waypoint. Since the UAV autopilot skipped the downwind-to-base waypoint and the base-to-final waypoint; the UAV autopilot made the unexpected left turn (shortest distance) to the upwind-crosswind waypoint. The operators notice immediately that the initiated a left turn instead of the predicted right turn. Because of this anomaly; the UAV operators took manual control (autopilot OFF) of the UAV in order to force the UAV to turn right in order to remain within the assigned SUA and in the correct traffic pattern. When the UAV operators took manual control; a link delay caused the UAV to momentary level its' wings before executing the appropriate command. This link delay was also a contributing factor that caused the UAV to momentarily penetrate the SUA. It is predicted that the UAV penetrated 500-750 feet outside the SUA while maneuvering to get back inside the SUA and on course.",,,,"A military UAV autopilot unexpectedly switched to waypoint tracking which caused a track deviation outside of special use airspace (SUA) as it entered a Test and Evaluation flight landing pattern so the pilot took remote manual control and reentered the SUA.",

This belief was largely based upon current case law: 'A recent NTSB decisional order states that 'model aircraft' operations are not bound by FAA oversight; as they do not currently meet the definition of an 'aircraft.' This precedent made it my understanding that no existing FAA law or regulation was violated during the operation of my 'model aircraft' equipment in late September (in fact; no official FAA law; rule; or regulation currently exists for model aircraft operation; as no such policies have been submitted to and approved by Congress).  FLIGHT SAFETY:My first priority was and always is; flight safety. After scouting the location; I carefully considered whether this flight would in any way cause harm or pose a safety risk to people and/or property both on the ground and in the air. I concluded that the flight could proceed as planned at the specified location; because it could be performed with zero risk to safety. In addition to commonly known safety practices for model aircraft; I implemented the following procedures to ensure a safe flight operation: Safe Location: The site includes a 4-story condo building located roughly a mile from the MSP airport; set on the edge of a wildlife refuge at an estimated 80 - 100 feet below airport grade elevation. Located nearby; in between the site location and the airport; are tall; 10-story office buildings directly to the north and west. Non-Navigable Airspace: The adjacent tall buildings and lower-lying site location create an area of non-navigable airspace by traditional aircraft. Additionally; the location in focus is not aligned with any runway arrival paths. Low Flight Altitude/Position: The flight was limited to the immediate 4-story condo building area at altitudes from the surface to no more than roof-height of any buildings. The majority of flight time was spent over the trees toward the river valley at altitudes around 50 feet high. Monitored MSP Traffic Flow: The flight was planned to take place at a time when air traffic at MSP was limited to arrivals and departures from runways 12 L/R; plus departures-only from runway 17. At all times; I maintained a listening watch of the south tower (123.675) for active departures off Runway 17. When an aircraft was instructed to line up and wait for departure; I would immediately land; and wait for traffic to take off and completely clear to the southeast before proceeding. Maximum time to react; land; and disarm the vehicle from any given point in flight is less than 10 seconds. Fail Safe: Flight position and direct line-of-sight was maintained at all times; and a home location was set and verified prior to take off. Horizontal flight range was limited to non-navigable airspace and go-home altitude was set to 60-feet; thus ensuring that the vehicle would never enter active; controlled; navigable airspace.SUMMARY: Considering the absence of any enforceable FAA regulation for this type of operation; I did not at the time of flight; and still do not believe that I was in violation of any laws; rules; or regulation.I consider myself a foremost expert in the new and emerging field of model aircraft operation. I take pride in the fact that I have maintained a flawless safety and reliability record. Additionally; I consistently apply professional aviation knowledge; experience; and skill during every model aircraft flight. Although I flew in a completely safe manner; with proper precautions and contingencies; I do regret my decision to fly within close proximity to the MSP airport. I realize now that this action may have been cause for great concern. I wholeheartedly and sincerely apologize for operating near the MSP airport. Moving forward; I will cease any and all flights within Class B airspace; or within close proximity to an airport.",,"A small; fixed wing unmanned aircraft was launched somewhere near Loeb Lake/Marydale Park in Saint Paul and ascended to the east for about 20 minutes.

I am here on yet another overtime shift and even with me and another overtime we are still below numbers. So there is an issue right there but not the one we are here for. So I am working R42 with 46 combined. I am aware that we have an UAV returning. I have already been looking for him and have seen his code and started the track for him when he calls center. I tell him to go ahead and he says he is giving us a radio check 7 min south of VYLLA. I give him his code and have him ident and radar identify him 30 miles south of VYLLA. He is level at FL210. I go about work and have the supervisor call the inbound since I am busy with two sectors and two frequencies; so I'm already dealing with frequency congestion with the two sectors frequencies. I now have a BE20 call me south of VYLLA and I radar identify him level at FL200. Unexpectedly; the UAV starts descending. He is still south of VYLLA and about 4 miles east of the BE20. So separation is already lost. I call the UAV and tell him to climb to FL210. He doesn't respond and continues descent. I call again and he finally answers and I clear him back to FL210 and call the traffic. He acknowledges and says returning to FL210. I then try to ascertain why he was descending to FL200. He responds by saying he has just leveled at FL200 after I had cleared him and he acknowledged the climb to FL210! I again tell him to climb and maintain FL210 and I also turned him 20 right since he and the BE20 were both converging at VYLLA and since he clearly didn't understand my clearance to FL210. He again acknowledges the climb and turn and finally starts the climb. As soon as the BE20 enters my airspace I descend him to FL180. I keep trying to get the UAV pilot to give me his reason for his descent and I finally get that they had just made a 'pilot swap' and that the LOA states they cross into US airspace at FL200 so he just descended to FL200. I ask if the Controller had issued that crossing instruction and he says negative it is in the LOA. I advised him the LOA doesn't supersede ATC clearances and he cannot descend without a clearance from ATC. If we are expected to work more and more UAVs then the pilots of the UAVs need to be trained pilots in the NAS. They should hold current pilots licenses with proper ratings. They need to understand they must obey all ATC clearances and that an ATC clearance supersedes any other LOA or flight plan or anything. Also UAVs are notoriously hard to get a hold of sometimes and they often go NORDO for long periods of time. Their radios are poor and transmissions are hard to understand much of the time. If this UAV hadn't finally responded to me he could have been over VYLLA at FL200 at the same time as the BE20. Of course I would have tried to move the BE20 but when dealing with Foreign ATC sometimes they get lost in the transfer and they don't ship aircraft until they are over VYLLA. This could have been worse than a loss of separation. I feel that we need to relook at UAVs in the NAS. Are they safe? Are the pilots properly trained and do they understand how things operate in the NAS?",,,,"ZAB Controller reports a UAV descending without clearance; causing loss of separation with a BE20.

However; scheduled maintenance was being performed on 13R; leaving the shorter 13L as the active runway. After close coordination with airfield manager and air operations office; the longer 13R was cleared and made available as long as necessary for a landing. At approximately XB00; the crew commanded a gear retraction resulting in both the nose- and starboard-gear retracting normally. However; the port-gear actually extended further to approximately halfway down. The crew then commanded gear down resulting in the nose- and starboard-gear extending normally and the port-gear remaining in place. In accordance with the Gear Will Not Extend checklist; the crew proceeded to 'bump' the gear. This action resulted in an approximately 1-2' port-gear movement down. While monitoring servo temperatures closely; this procedure was repeated approximately 25 more times. During the bump procedure; C-Band downlink signals began to degrade. Aircraft X was operating Line-of-Sight (LOS) and the crew had made no changes to the datalink configuration. The signal strengths dropped to zero on both Downlink 1 & 2. Aircraft X was approximately 16 nm from the Ground Data Terminal (GDT) and had uplink signal strengths of approximately 50%. The crew lost all video and telemetry; and the aircraft was no longer being displayed on the tracker map. The LRE crew tried changing Aircraft X's heading and switched GDT receivers with no change. The crew initiated the Inflight checklist. However; the loss of the C-Band downlink lasted for 3-4 minutes then suddenly came back on its own. Signal strengths displayed normal and did not degrade for the remainder of the flight. With C-band link re-established; the IP LRE left to call [Government Agency A] regarding the landing when its nose gear failed to extend. Additionally; the Safety supervisor requested the written findings from that incident be sent for review and application of any lessons learned. When the port-gear stopped responding to 'bump' commands; the visual indications were that it was approximately 2' from locked as compared to the starboard-gear. Several attempts were made to induced further movement through G-loading with negative results. At XC01; with agreement that there were no other alternative actions that could be performed and clearance received to land on 13R; the decision was made to dump fuel down to approximately 600 pounds and commence the approach to land. Cursory research indicated that the unsafe gear indication would notclear via a gear 'bump.' Visual observation was the only method of ascertaining gear status. ZZZ was contacted and briefed on UAV differences and safety considerations to include no personnel on board; the 600 pound fuel load; composite material construction; wing pods were inert; and that the aircraft would land on the right side (starboard-gear) of the runway and shut down where stopped. Another available supervisor was dispatched to the airfield control tower to act as liaison; if necessary; throughout the landing. All checklists were completed for landing and clearance was received at XC36 with winds reported at 110/14. At XC44 the crew executed a successful landing on 13R; gradually slowing the aircraft down with reverse thrust while being careful not to use the brakes. The gear remained down and the aircraft responded to steering commands. [Aircraft X] rolled to a stop approximately midfield and was shut down. Link was maintained to monitor the aircraft in case it started to roll while maintenance personnel made their way to the aircraft to tow it to the hangar. [Aircraft X] was towed without incident and it was discovered that the gear was down and on the stops. [Aircraft X] completed a modification to Trailing Arm Landing Gear (TALG) [recently]. Since completion; the port-gear electric servo accumulated 76.9 flight hours; 17 gear cycles (extensions-retractions); and 10 landings.",,,,"An MQ-9 landing after a training mission; was delayed because the left main landing gear apparently did not fully extend.

I believed that my COA restricted me from flying within 5 miles of a towered airport without either authorization from the local ATC (i.e. tower) OR an amended COA setting out procedures for flying within 5 miles of a towered airport. I believed that I was following all requirements in my Section 333 waiver and COA when I was planning my flight to capture video footage for a TV station after a tornado. I filed a NOTAM and contacted the tower because my intended flight path came within 3.5 miles of a towered airport. After a description of my intended operation with the ATC tower manager which included the location of my flight; the anticipated duration of my flight(s); my flight path; the NOTAM #; my N#; and altitude (surface to 100ft) the ATC manager cleared the flight and I told him I would call back when it was concluded. I conducted 3 short flights totaling 20 minutes or less maintaining visual line of sight of the UAV at or below 100 ft AGL without incident. However; a day after the flights another pilot mentioned to me that he thought I needed a special COA to fly within 5 miles of a towered airport. I told him that it was my understanding that EITHER an amended COA OR authorization from the local ATC or airport tower manager was sufficient but that both were not required under my 333. I have actually applied for a special COA based upon the ATC at the tower where my home airport is located refusing to authorize any commercial UAV flights within 5 miles of their airport because they have never received a request from a 333 waiver holder. Although my home base ATC manager did not cite any safety concerns for refusing to authorize UAV flights he did say that he would send it up the chain of command. Since the ATC tower manager at the airport near which the flight which is the subject of this report 'cleared' and authorized my flight I believed that I was in compliance with all regulations. However; upon reviewing my Section 333 waiver and COA I saw that the specific language requires either a special COA OR Letter of Agreement (LOA) for flights within 5 miles of an airport. In the event that a LOA is required to actually be a written letter as opposed to a verbal communication authorizing the flight operation; although I complied with the intent of the rules by getting authorization for the flight I may not have been in compliance with the letter of the law. If that is the case my error was certainly unintentional based upon my misunderstanding of the requirements in my Section 333 waiver and COA. Unfortunately local ATC personnel are not familiar with the requirements and several attempts to contact FSDO with questions about my special COA application have not been successful. Additionally; since I did not have any commercial flights at all in 2015 (they were all training flights on my property) I did not file the monthly reports required under my 333 when due. However; after clarifying that the reports were due even of no flights were conducted I did file all past reports before the end of the year 2015 and I recently filed my January 2016 report. Although there is no guidance suggesting when the reports are due I have marked my calendar to file monthly reports within the 30 day period following the month in which the report is due.",,,,"A commercial UAS Operator was granted permission from local ATC to fly 3.5 miles from the Class C airport; but later questioned whether a Section 333 Letter of Agreement and Certificate of Authorization were legally required for his intended operation.",

The paperwork provided a brief description of what to expect from a flight that was to fly through my airspace (Aircraft X). The paperwork said Aircraft X would orbit in NTTR for 2+00 hrs. When the aircraft checked on; he asked to proceed to KL45M and hold for two hours. I said proceed as requested because I thought that was a part of the pre-coordinated route that had been established. Once I realized he was turning towards the restricted airspace I called and asked Nellis if Aircraft X could in fact come in and hold as he requested. They said unable and he had to stay out of the airspace. From that point; I got busy at the sector and was trying to get answers from management as to what I needed to do with this aircraft since he was not allowed into the restricted airspace like we had planned. I put Aircraft X on a heading to stall and try to find answers. When I tried to issue him holding instructions he informed me that he is unable to accept 'FAA Holding instructions' and was just requesting a 'delay.' I have no idea what issuing a 'delay' does and how I can possibly ensure separation or ensure I know what the aircraft is doing if I simply tell him to delay as requested. I was then handed paperwork on an area of airspace and instructed to ask the Aircraft X pilot if he was familiar with 'the ops area northeast of LAS.' The aircraft was not familiar. The whole thing was a cluster and I was busy with other airplanes and normal complexity of an already busy sector. I felt like my entire area had no idea how to handle the situation; including the MOS (Military Operations Specialist) who had been called down to help me or try to provide answers. Aircraft X ended up just flying in circles in my sector with no real 'holding' instructions established because he couldn't accept them. There was no incident but it was a safety issue because the level of distraction that this one operation caused me put my sector in an unsafe situation.These drone operations need to be more clearly defined and the pilots need to be made aware of the requirements. They can't just expect to get to hold and not be able to accept holding instructions.

We were flying under a COA (Certificate of Approval) for a public university; as employees of that university; flying an aircraft owned and registered by that university and on land owned by the university. She was never visible to my Visual Observer (VO) or myself during the flight. The mission was a training and familiarization flight for the UAS. There was never any intent to do anything other than fly a practice photogrammetry mission at 75 meters elevation. The land we were flying over was undeveloped university owned open space with some trees and bushes that has a dirt road around it and signs posted that the trails and land are closed for reclamation. People are allowed to walk on the road but not off it. We were parked on the road but were flying over the open space. We; as university employees; are allowed to be anywhere on the land since we are employees doing work and research. I explained to her that we were within our right to fly there but she was combative and did not want to hear the rules at play. I eventually told her to call the police; which she did. An officer from our police department came and talked with us; he was helpful and nice. As employees who were clearly authorized to be there and doing research within all applicable laws he simply left after a few moments and we continued with our flying operations. My concern is how a citizen who has no understanding of the rules at play in a UAS operation such as ours can approach us and distract us from our operation. If we happened to be flying at the time she accosted us it would have certainly been a violation of the 'sterile cockpit' principal and could have caused an accident or mishap. If the UAS would have been 50lbs instead of 5lbs this could have posed a risk to life and limb. I am considering implementing a policy in our UAS operations where we have a 'guard' with us when we fly larger UAS. This guard's sole responsibility would be to ensure that nobody approaches the PIC or VO when flight operations are being conducted. 99.9 percent of individuals we encounter when we are flying UAS are pleasant; never distract anybody who is flying; and are just interested in the watching or learning about the technology. It's fairly easy to maintain a 'sterile cockpit' from outsiders in an airliner with a hardened door. It's another thing entirely to maintain a 'sterile cockpit' when anybody can simply walk up behind you and distract you from flight operations.",,,,"A UAS pilot employed by a university reported being confronted by a passerby on school property which caused a distraction.

The aircraft responded by maintaining altitude and airspeed and continuing the left turn to the commanded heading. During the course of these events the aircraft completed a 180 degree turn through Canada and crossed back into the United States.As the preprogrammed track had been one mile from the border; there was little time to catch the unanticipated change in the flight path.

The previous sector was having difficulty switching the aircraft; and after he was about 10 miles into our airspace; he finally checked on. The briefing I was given was the pilot was supposed to give me a 10 min warning before he started dropping buoys out of his airplane; and that he needed a 20 mile radius with no airplanes. Aircraft X then asked to start dropping the buoys in 3 min (not the 10 min warning I was briefed) and that he wanted the 20 mile radius. As I tried to get more information on the buoys; size; shape; how many; if they go all the way to the ground; the only information the pilot was able to tell me was that he wanted to drop one every 10 min. I told him he was not authorized to drop at that moment; that I had to move airplanes out of his way and that I would let him know when he could drop the first one. I moved the airplanes; and tried to call him up and I did not receive a response. I tried him three more times and let the CIC know what was going on (although; he heard me and already had an idea of what was going on). He got the OM (Operations Manager) involved; who then called to the pilot on the phone. The pilot said that he was having communication issues. Once the pilot reported back on my frequency; I informed him that I had built him the 20 mile hole that he had requested; but that I could not get ahold of him. If he requests to be dropping things out of the airplane with a 20 mile sterilized airspace; then he has to be in communication with me and monitoring the frequency. I authorized the first drop and switched him to the next sector. As I went to get the call sign; a different OM was working the desk and I explained the situation. He told me that they don't need 20 miles; he has no idea where that came from; and that they are authorized to drop the buoys out of the airplane. The 10 min warning is just as a heads up and he is responsible solely for the release of the instruments. The buoys are small and if they run into another airplane; no harm will come to them. He then proceeded to tell me that I had no authority to tell the pilot that he could not drop the buoys. He pulled up the section of the 7110.65 and showed it to me. That is all great and wonderful; but that information would have served me and the drone pilot much better prior to this incident.

During my continual runway scan; I noticed that Aircraft X appeared not to be moving; and due to the time of night; size/shape of the UAV; and my prior understanding of the excessively slow taxi speeds of Aircraft X; doubt started to surface in my mind whether or not Aircraft X was clear of the runway. I continued to monitor the movement of Aircraft X until its stationary position made me uncomfortable enough to begin a transmission that would have cancelled my departure's takeoff clearance. However; just as I keyed up; Aircraft X began moving again; and I finished the transmission with 'DISREGARD'. Nonetheless; the departing pilot advised that they were aborting takeoff. I continued to watch Aircraft X slowly taxi into their parking ramp as I instructed my departure to exit the runway.My first issue with this event is the lack of training I have received in reference to handling unmanned aircraft. I was advised by another controller that the procedures for working UAVs had been ironed out the same night despite the aircraft already having flown for a few months. Management has provided little to no training on procedures to work these aircraft who require special handling because they are unmanned. This lack of training is mostly due; in my estimation; to poor staffing and poor management. Had the shift been staffed properly; controllers wouldn't be placed in situations such as these where we're on position for extended periods of time; forced to take shortened breaks; etc. Moreover; I believe the Supervisor in charge of the shift and responsible for preparing the control position rotation was negligent creating an unnecessarily strenuous rotation straining controller's abilities.

I had filed a UAS operating area report with Flight Services in an effort to warn air traffic I would be operating in the area; the altitude I would be at; and the exact times of operation. We also had a hand held VHF aviation radio turned on and operating on 122.9 frequency. A visual observer was also on site and fully briefed. Approximately 15 SM [from] BTR the drone was operating at 375 ft AGL flying a grid pattern over [area we were to photograph]. I was facing south maintaining visual contact with the drone; my visual observer was facing north in my blind spot; the drone was 692 ft laterally from my location. The visual observer yelled out an aircraft sighting report; I turned to look and saw a Cessna 172 flying at approximately the same altitude as the drone on what appeared to be a collision course approximately .4-.25 miles from the drones position. The Cessna pilot did not seem to see the drone; he was operating at or below 500 ft in my estimation; and was obscured from view on the ground behind a tree line until he cleared the trees. We did not hear his engine until after he cleared the trees. I immediately took evasive action; reducing done altitude to ground level as fast as possible (cut the engines). The drone crash landed and did not visibly impact the Cessna; the Cessna continued on without visible deviation from its flight route. It is my belief that the Cessna was operating as a pipeline patrol aircraft since a pipeline was in close proximity and the pilot was at such a low altitude. This was a VERY high potential near miss. While I was able to see and avoid the Cessna it is debatable if he was able to see my drone. If the Cessna pilot had filed a flight plan or called flight services I feel he should have had ample warning of my intended area of operation and flight level. As a licensed sUAS operator and a current student pilot I can see conflicts between low flying aircraft and drones outside controlled airspace becoming more common; especially in cases like my experience. There needs to be a better way to freely communicate drone activities with pilots and more emphasis given to pilots to check UAS operating areas before they fly; especially when flying below or near 400 ft AGL.",,,,"Drone pilot operating under FAR part 107 reported a NMAC with a C172 at about 400 feet AGL.

On initial setup I checked the FAA B4UFLY app and noticed that the area I was currently in was restricted. Once I checked under the reasons why it informed me that it was due to Alert Area A-231. I then checked my terminal area chart on Foreflight to see what the restrictions were for A-231 and found out that it was from 500 AGL to 6500 MSL. The operation I intended to perform was only going to be up to 100 AGL and I quickly glanced to make sure I was not in conflict with any other airspace and under the B shelf. Having done most of my flight training in Phoenix I felt that I was certain that it was acceptable to operate my drone. After no conflicts and completing the flight; then proceeded to another property located a street over. Again I was prompted that flight was restricted due to A-231; again I continued to proceed cautiously. After performing 3 operations all within the same area I stopped for the day. Later that evening it bothered me that I didn't understand why I was getting a restricted message and I looked at the terminal chart once again. I then noticed that next to the A-231 boundary there is an SATR (Special Air Traffic Rules) starting at the surface and up to 4000. The SATR states that all aircraft need to establish two-way communication with and maintain communication with LUKE APP while operating in the airspace. It is then; that I realized that I may have been in conflict with this SATR and right on the border of the defining limits. My previous flight experience in the area lead me into a trap of not checking the airspace as closely as I should have because the SATR is new since I last operated flights in the area. Going further; I need to pay extra caution to all available information including the B4UFLY app to avoid any further conflicts.",,,,"A UAS pilot operating near LUF realized he was flying in Alert Area A-231; but thought it was legal below 500 feet.

However; it has been bugging me that I did fly in Class D without permission.  I have been thinking about what I would do differently.  For example; perhaps I would try to contact the tower with my hand-held radio.  This would be difficult because I am not high enough to get a good signal to the airport.  Should I have given them a call to let them know?  Would they think I was nuts if I called them about a little drone that would not have an effect on their operations?

Unfortunately; when I made my turn; I ended up a few degrees shy of exactly 180; which made my return track not perfectly parallel with my original track; and the drone drifted into a construction crane.I guess I would say the problem was caused by me not realizing that my horizontal track wasn't exactly the same as the first. To prevent this in the future I will use a waypoint mode to program and define preset GPS points along a predetermined route that are known to be obstacle free. Or a 'track' mode; that will 'fix' the compass heading so that no deviation is possible. That way the drone can fly the route; allowing the operator to work the camera with confidence that the drone won't hit anything.The only other thing that could have prevented this would be additional obstacle avoidance sensors installed on the drone. The drone has obstacle avoidance sensors facing forward; and downward only. If there were sensors on the sides; rear; and top as well; theoretically; it would be impossible to crash into anything.

At the time Aircraft X was operating on a complex clearance at or above FL500 which requires the aircraft to remain within the R-2508 complex. At XA:00 Aircraft X requested his IFR clearance. I issued Aircraft X a clearance to the BTY244044 via the BTY244044 fix then as filed and to cross the R-2508 boundary in a block altitude FL510-FL590.

My trainee was working Aircraft X in the local traffic pattern on runway 36. He also had Aircraft Z in the traffic pattern on runway 36 and Aircraft Y was inbound on a visual approach to runway 9. Aircraft X was in the right downwind and told to extend downwind; the purpose of this was for Aircraft X to do his option after Aircraft Y had landed and exited the runway. The military flies the UAVs and is restricted to only flying in the Class Delta. The trainee had timed it appropriately so he would turn Aircraft X's base prior to the edge of the Delta and the conflict would be resolved. The pilot of Aircraft X said they needed to turn their base early (about 2 miles from the airport). The trainee reluctantly told Aircraft X to turn their base. The supervisor in the tower cab immediately spoke up that the UAVs shouldn't be extended in that area as they 'could lose their engine over populated areas' and would rather do 360's in the downwind or enter high key over the airport. Aircraft X was short final runway 36 and was a conflict with Aircraft Y landing runway 9. The trainee initiated a go around to Aircraft X. This created an unsafe situation as we didn't know these unmanned planes had these special restrictions. This situation wasn't busy or complex; but it created a situation where if Aircraft Y needed to go around for any reason; he would have been in conflict with Aircraft X; who was also going around; they would have met airborne over the intersection of runway 36 and 9. To make it worse; Aircraft Z was in the right downwind across the departure path of runway 9.I have only worked the local unmanned aircraft flown by our military while training and only a few times; but I have noticed the extra care that needs to be taken while working these aircraft. These are VFR aircraft in the traffic pattern; but they are unable to see and avoid. They cannot follow traffic and their traffic patterns need to be completely controlled by the controllers; their bases need to be called to follow traffic and for wake turbulence delays. Not only is this extra work to be constantly watching and timing their patterns; we also need to be mindful if the aircraft goes lost link; where it will fly the shortest route to its lost link orbit location. This could mean the aircraft will immediately make a turn across the airport; if we don't see it happen soon enough and take action to move everyone else; we could have an unmanned aircraft cutting off and flying into arrivals or departures from any one of our three runways. Now management is telling us also that we also need to keep them away from populated areas and that they worry about their engines quitting. I'm not sure why these aircraft are more susceptible to lose an engine than any other single engine aircraft; but if they are and the operators want to remain clear of populated areas; that needs to be addressed in the LOA that they have with tower. The military unit has been vocal about wanting to fly both of their UAVs in the pattern at the same time. There are times without them when it is busy and we don't have much room in our local traffic pattern. Sometimes aircraft need to extend and sometimes they need to exit the delta. This is something we expect all aircraft in our pattern to be able to accept and we shouldn't have to make exceptions that jeopardize the safety of others; whether it be the flying public or people on the ground.",,,,"FAR Local Controller reported an operation involving a military UAV that was being conducted not in accordance with the LOA.",

I experienced a near miss with a low flying aircraft. I was taking pictures of the surf and cliffs for my photography portfolio. I was flying a UAS. I launched from the parking area overlooking the beach; altitude about 71ft MSL. Visibility was reported as greater than 10 NM; winds less than 4 MPH. Although visibility along the beach was unlimited to the South; [it was] about .9 Miles to the North. I had completed filming and had instituted the automated Return-To-Home procedure. In this mode the aircraft climbs to its designated RTH altitude and autonomously flies back and lands at its launch or 'Home' point. Although on autopilot the aircraft still responds to the controls. At this point; I observed and heard an aircraft flying low (a little above the top of the bluff which at that point is 71ft MSL) along the beach that had come from the North around the point. My first reaction was to dive the drone and I started to descend but I realized that it was already above the level of the approaching aircraft so I reversed throttle and continued the climb to evade. The aircraft passed below the drone which was at about 244ft MSL altitude and between the drone and I. The aircraft was a low-wing; single-engine; monoplane; dark in color. The pilot gave no indication that he saw the UAS and continued flying South along the beach. Although the sectional charts list the Minimum Safe Altitude in the area at over 1;000 ft; aircraft sometimes fly along the beach because it is very scenic with the ocean view stretching out to the horizon. This also creates the illusion that other aircraft can be seen well in time to be avoided. But the coast is not a straight line and aircraft skimming the bluffs over the beach are masked by bluffs at points along the coast. In this case the bluff [at the] point only .9 mile away masked the aircraft from my view and vice versa and it was in my flight space with almost no time to react. Pilots should expect to encounter [UAS]. FAA should remind pilots that even if visibility is unlimited; small drones can only be seen at best a mile away and they should avoid tracing the beach contour even if visual flight rules allow it.",,,,"UAS Operator reported a NMAC with an unidentified small aircraft in VMC at low altitude over coastal bluffs.",

On top of that it was running new code that changed how lost comms got handled so that we would not land on top of a payload carried in sling load. We had run the code in the simulator and with the tweaks; we were happy with the performance. We did a ground run of the helicopter to cycle the new batteries that we had purchased and to exercise the tail motor; which yielded nominal change in the performance. I flew the V-10ET starting with just a normal return to service flight with maneuvering in fully stable and mission mode to run our lost comms plan to validate if it did execute the maneuver as planned.

With the altitude we had and almost zero forward airspeed; an autorotation was not possible from a pilot override. Post-crash inspection showed only damage to the side frames of the helicopter; main rotor; tail rotor and swash arms. The repair cost was under 500 dollars for the items that needed repair or replacement.Our internal investigation revealed we had a connector failure due to the new batteries being able to provide more current when needed then our old set of batteries. This caused the main flight battery connector to heat up and melt when the current draw increased beyond what the connectors where rated for. It was a combination of new batteries; new software that was more aggressive; and connectors that where sub-par for what was needed with the new software.",,,,"UAV Operator reported loss of aircraft control resulting in ground impact with some damage to the UAV.",

My first thought was that the weather was IFR and it didn't seem right to be flying any Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in a Class D in IFR conditions. I then did some research; and after looking through the Certificate of Authorization (COA) and our LOA with the Sheriff's department; I saw that they were only authorized to fly in VMC conditions. I looked at the previous METARs for the day and saw it had been IFR the whole day. The visibility at the time was below 2 miles. The NOTAM for the UAS activity stated the defined area was a 2-mile radius from the FAR126002 and stated that it was 2.2 miles southeast of the West Fargo airport (D54) from surface to 400ft AGL. The FAR126002 would put the area about 11 southeast of D54; but the smoke from the fire was visible from the tower and it was clear that it was indeed 2.2 Southeast of D54. Later in the evening; I took a phone call from someone at approximately 4.5 miles South-southwest of the Fargo airport; or around 4 South-southeast from D54. The caller asked if the Sheriff's department called to notify us that they were flying a UAS. I acknowledged that though I didn't receive a call; that I believed they did call before my shift that day. The caller sounded concerned but didn't ask anything further. I then realized that the Sanford Hospital Heliport was within the defined area of the UAS activity. Since I didn't take the call and I wasn't in charge of the facility at the time; I assumed everything was being done correctly; but I did raise my concern with the supervisor on duty that I questioned whether they should be flying in IFR conditions. I believe this was an unsafe situation as we had IFR aircraft arriving on an ILS approach that got with a half mile of the defined area of the UAS activity. The defined area also had a radius of 2 miles and the visibility was less than 2 miles. I also realized after the call that this definitely could conflict with a medevac flight off Sanford Hospital. We were required to keep aircraft out of the defined area of the UAS activity. If a medevac helicopter wanted to depart Sanford Hospital; whether IFR or SVFR; we wouldn't have been able to allow it. The NOTAM wasn't cancelled until the next day in the morning. I recommend that pilots and COA holders be held accountable. It seems that law enforcement is under the impression that they can do whatever they want in situations like this; but there are procedures in place for a reason. Thankfully; nothing happened to conflict with the UAS activity in this situation; but there was potential for something dangerous and I would not want to be the one held accountable or the one denying any law enforcement activity because they are being unsafe.",,,,"KFAR Tower Controller reported an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) operating in class D; under IFR conditions; contrary to the Certificate of Authorization and LOA.",

The local airport manager did approach me and asked me to land the UAS as he stated it was illegal to operate near an airport; and I did land and attempted to contact the local FSDO by phone. Later the airport manager made contact with the local [FAAST Program Manager] at the FSDO who stated by phone it was 'illegal to operate a drone within 5nm of an airport'. Despite that not being true under 14CFR107; we did not operate the UAS further; and left the airport. [Local] FSDO emailed me stating 'I am attempting to contact you regarding UAS (drone) operation at the ZZZ airport yesterday. I have some questions I need to ask of you.'

We operated a transponder and ADS-B equipped hq-90b UAS. This aircraft is certified for operation under a certificate of waiver or authorization. A NOTAM was filed and was accessible by normal means. TRACON was informed of UAS operation prior to launching operation. We have VHF communications and we were close to launching the VTOL fixed wing aircraft from taxiway Bravo. The Cirrus approached from the ramp toward the taxiway. For safety reasons for all involved; one of my air vehicle operator ground team members; wearing a fluorescent shirt; gave a stop hand signal to the approaching Cirrus pilot to make him aware of the UAS that was sitting on the taxiway and which was ready to launch. The Cirrus pilot stopped and got on the radio (UNICOM) to inquire about why a lineman was stopping him. I politely told him my n-number and explained that we are a UAS that was about to depart for a local flight. The Cirrus pilot used unprofessional phraseology to assert his dissatisfaction. I explained that we will be in the air in less than 1 minute and out of his way. He then went on a lecture about the lack of a NOTAM. I politely explained that a NOTAM was filed. I made my call for our aircraft to launch and we got it into a stable orbit at 400 ft AGL away from all runways and well inside and below the normal traffic pattern. As the Cirrus was taxiing to the runway; I made a call on UNICOM; indicating that we are in a stable left hand orbit; clear and south of both runways at 400 AGL (1100 MSL). The Cirrus pilot kept making a number of additional; very unprofessional calls indicating his dissatisfaction. In one call; he asked if he was going to hit the UAV. I am not sure if I replied but I think I simply stated that we were orbiting south of both runways. This pilot clearly did not read the pertinent NOTAMS as required by 91.103 because he should have found it without problem under the UAS section. As both a manned and unmanned operator and as a researcher who is focused on developing means to integrate UAS safely into US airspace; I can understand that some people who are unfamiliar with UAS may have questions or concerns. Our UAS is not a small UAS; it is a 100-lb aircraft with sophisticated capabilities such as VTOL; long endurance; transponder; dual data link; etc. The operation is performed under the umbrella of a coa (Certificate of Authorization) with significant oversight from the FAA. The learning point from this encounter with an unprofessional pilot is that we cannot assume that NOTAMs for UAS operations are being found or read. It would be good to have a way to put a short audible into the ASOS voice loop about this. At the same time; we should be able to rely on other pilots to refrain from unprofessional phraseology which has no place in aircraft radio transmissions and that safety should be the overriding concern at all times. Road rage like behavior and bullying is not a suitable mental state for operators of any aircraft.",,,,"UAS operator reported a conflict with a taxiing aircraft just prior to launch from an airport taxiway.

Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) holds both Part 61 (manned) certificate and Part 107 (remote) certificate. A Visual Observer (VO); also a Part 61 & Part 107 pilot; was also scanning for traffic and other potential hazards in and around the planned operating environment. The crew had an aviation-band transceiver available to monitor the local airport's CTAF frequency; a small untowered/uncontrolled GA airport located approximately 1 nm away. No manned aircraft were heard (over the radio or via engine noise) or visually observed during the entirety of the day's flights and the UAS was not within the airport's approach/departure paths. The RPIC had eyes on the UAS while maneuvering to ensure UAS did not fly close to obstacles (primarily trees & power lines when closer to ground) or over areas that may have contained nonparticipants (yards; roads). The planned route was chosen to be free from most factors; with the few road crossings performed safely when there was no vehicular traffic in the vicinity (RPIC and Visual Observer both verbally verify prior to crossing). After all obstacles were well cleared and the UAS was maneuvered into position and had begun data collection; the RPIC checked the display and noticed the flight display software's telemetry data had been reset to display metric and was indicating approximately 150 meters. Knowing the metric equivalent of 400 FT is approximately 122m; the RPIC initiated an immediate descent. Contributing Factors: RPIC's focus on ensuring the UAS was not flown near obstacles or over people; coupled with the delayed awareness of the software displaying telemetry information in metric units. Corrective Actions (real-time): Upon noticing an indicated altitude in excess of 400 FT AGL; the RPIC immediately descended the UAS below 400 FT (122m) AGL indicated. Corrective Actions (future procedures): In the future; pre-flight checklist will include verification that software units are displayed in feet (not metric) and the software-based altitude limit is enabled and properly set (when able). RPIC will also refer to flight display more frequently as the aircraft is climbing (assuming safe to do so) and call out altitudes passing through during major ascents/descents. Additionally; when the flight profile allows; RPIC will de-couple climbs/descents from horizontal maneuvering; particularly if the UAS is approaching the altitude limit or may be operating in the vicinity of other considerations (obstacles; roads; nonparticipants; etc.) which may take attention away from altitude awareness.",,,,"Remote pilot reported the UAV was flown to an altitude that was likely in excess of the 400 FT AGL limitation specified within FAR Part 107.

I forgot about the temporary flight restriction for the area and flew my DJI Inspire 2. I was fully aware of the TFR and the day prior had briefed production so we would avoid the area. Our plan was to film at [a] university and two other locations near the campus midtown area; not [in the TFR location]. All three locations were permitted. I filed the required campus flight plan with Icarusmap.com. I had my insurance put [the university] on the COI (Certificate of Insurance).Here is the background of my forgetting about the [TFR]. Two days prior; production had switched our shoot from Florida to [another state] due to client cancelation. So I had to change my plans overnight. This meant checking the airspace for authorization; which I did. The plan was to catch the morning light so we met [early] in the lobby of our hotel. It was an overcast day so we called off the shoot for the morning and hoped for sun later. [Around mid-morning] the sun came out so we hustled into the van. Our team was pilot in command (me); show runner/producer and a driver. As we started from the hotel the producer liked the light on the buildings and asked if we could do a quick reveal shot. Without remembering the TFR I agreed; and we set up and launched quickly for a short 10 minute flight. It was VFR weather; VLOS (Visual Line of Sight); not over people; under 400 feet. I had a camera operator and spotter. Later while we were coordinating with Campus police; they informed us about the VIP arriving [nearby]; which was going to cause highway congestion. This is when I remembered the TFR.I am disappointed with myself for this mistake. I have been a commercial airline pilot for over 20 years and take pride in my safety record. Running my drone business has been a learning experience; which means I need to be even more cautious. I am changing my preflight checklist to include opening the app to ensure there have been no changes to the airspace; that I am in compliance; and most importantly; so this will not happen again.",,,,"UAV operator reported violation of a TFR.",

It was a nice; sunny day. The winds at takeoff were reported to be 070[@]010 but on takeoff they picked up somewhat. I went to approximately 300 feet AGL and then dropped down to approximately 250 AGL. I decided to enter an orbit mode to practice entering and setting up this 'intelligent' flight mode. It had been some time since I had practiced an auto flight orbit. After setting up my Point of Interest and defining the orbit radius; I started the orbit. The drone was circling in a counter-clockwise direction and seemed to be doing well. Approximately 11 minutes after takeoff I got a High Wind Velocity Caution; with guidance to land ASAP. Since I was in a rural area in Class G airspace with the drone clearly in sight; I was not too concerned.A two-lane country road ran east-west through the owner's property and my position was south of the road looking north. Although I could see the drone clearly; I could not see the road but had no intention of crossing the road with my orbit flight path. However; as the drone entered the downwind side of the orbit; I could tell its downwind ground track was going long (towards the north) and I might cross the road. I fumbled briefly trying to press the 'PAUSE' switch to stop the orbit. I pointed my camera straight down but by that time I discovered I had indeed crossed the road. I paused there and waited for a truck to pass. When it was clear; I initiated a 'Return-To-Home' and landed uneventfully. On a post video review a few days later; it appeared that I passed behind a moving vehicle traveling east but due to the angle of the camera set up for the orbit; I could not see the point where my ground track crossed the road or how close I was to the vehicle.Reflecting on this sortie; there are several things I failed to do and will do differently in the future: (1) Failed the check the low-altitude forecast winds for the altitude I was flying; (2) I failed to recognize the potential effect of the winds on the orbit path I set up; (3) I failed to terminate the automatic orbit when I received the High Wind Velocity Caution to see how the wind was affecting my ground track and then drop to a lower altitude to hand-fly the orbit or return to land. (4) I failed to position myself between my point of interest for the orbit and the road so that I could better tell when the drone was deviating from the flight path.",,,,"A drone operator taking photos reported they allowed their drone to fly over a moving vehicle.",

On the 'Flight Briefing' screen there was an amber banner that stated 'Authorization upon Submission' notice. The PIC then pressed the blue 'SUBMIT FLIGHT' button and a screen balloon appeared stating 'Success - Your flight plan has been submitted'. The AIRMAP program then displayed a map screen and a Flight Time banner appeared with a clock running just above a bottom blue banner labeled 'END FLIGHT'. We then flew twice at this location for a total of 23 minutes.We repeated this process at a location Number 2: Tempe Town Lake Marina located at 078 degrees at 1.9 NM from the PXR VOR. We flew at location Number 2 twice; totaling 15 minutes.While the PIC was operating the drone; I was auditing the flight by looking at AIRMAP on my phone and did not see the flight displayed.I alerted the PIC and he immediately terminated the flight. We tried several times to submit new flights on the PIC's phone; and on my phone; with the same results: AIRMAP processed the waiver requests; displayed normal indications that the waiver would be issued; and then started the flight timer. However; when selecting the flight plan details for previous flights; a red Waiver Not Approved banner became visible even though normal screens appeared when waivers were approved and the flight timer was running.At this point; I contacted a person that is involved in the local Aeroscope security network and he advised me to use a different LAANC provider.We relocated to location Number 3: 076 degrees at 1.5 NM from PXR VOR and used the Skyward portal. We immediately received authorization and a waiver number at this location; even though it was a [few] miles closer to PHX.We suspect that all four flights at locations Number 1 and Number 2 may have been flown without FAA Approval.Therefore; our UAS Operations Manual will be amended to require the FAA Waiver Authorization number be recorded on our flight manifest prior to takeoff.Additionally; we have contacted AIRMAP to repair their iPhone app.",,,,"UAV operator reported a possible airspace incursion occurred in the vicinity of PXR.",

Shortly after takeoff (~1.5 seconds); the aircraft was observed as acting in a strange manner (non-commanded oscillations and yaw movements). The Pilot in Command (PIC) reacted to the problem immediately and began the sequence for regaining control of the aircraft. 4 seconds later; the aircraft continued to ascend to ~35' AGL; still performing the uncharacteristic yaw/oscillation movements. It was the decision of the PIC (as per protocol) to land the aircraft immediately. The PIC was only able to control throttle at this point (5 seconds into flight). Therefore; he made the decision to decrease throttle at an extensive rate to land the aircraft abruptly. The aircraft landed ~50' from its original take off point. Total altitude throughout the entire mission was ~35'. The highest ground speed during the incident was ~5'/second. The aircraft performed an emergency landing. Although damage to the aircraft; 3rd party property was not damaged and no person (flight crew or otherwise) was physically harmed during the mishap. Preliminary analysis from the flight crew determined that there was a sensor issue triggered immediately after takeoff which induced uncommon aircraft characteristics. Further analysis of this issue will be performed to determine the root cause(s).

Having recently switched to a new aircraft and flight controls; my typical pre-flight tooling was not available on the new platform and lack of familiarity with the platform and incorrect memory of the local boundaries resulted in an incursion of no more than 100 yards or so in to ALB's airspace.I mis-remembered the boundaries as falling on the far side of Starbuck Island when in reality it was on the near side to my take off/landing point. My new DJI Smart Controller did not provide warnings in a format I was familiar with and integration on controller with AirMap and other LAANC based systems is currently not functional.My initial flight plan did not include a path that would have flown in to ALB's airspace; however; unexpected wind conditions on site caused my path out to be unsafe to return on due to having to fly under a bridge structure. I decided to approach over land above the empty construction site on the island as the safest course of action without remembering that this flight path would enter in to ALB Class C airspace.The intrusion was discovered post flight during a review that I undertook due to lack of confidence in my own memory of the boundaries. During this review; I discovered the error.As a corrective action; I plan to review charts prior to a flight when in near proximity to controlled airspace even if my initial plan is to stay within a known area outside of the controlled airspace.A broader corrective action would be to encourage more consistency and uptake of LAANC and the UAS facilities directory as the standard mapping system in sUAS control systems. The poorly implemented maps in DJI's Go app was a major contributor to the incident and such an incident would not have been possible flying under AirMap or a similar program which provides more accurate charting; however; such apps do not currently work with DJI's Smart Controller.Established FAA regulations helped ensure that the incident resolved well.

I tried to brief aircraft and adjacent facilities of the UAS while others called the police department. I had been forced to work a lot of traffic on the south side because Moffett denied extensions on the North side. With the observed UAS activity on the south side the CIC tried to get North extensions to be away from the UAS activity and Moffett denied the request without citing an operational need for the airspace. This resulted in more aircraft remaining in the South pattern and increased workload in my part to issue additional advisories regarding UAS activity due to the traffic being forced to fly in closer proximity to it; in addition to the complex airspace arrangement. This is another example of why the airspace between Palo Alto and Moffett Field needs to be redesigned. Having to make aircraft fly closer to uncoordinated UAS activity did not contribute to safely and efficiently moving aircraft through the NAS. I have previously filed a report about Palo Alto needing more airspace while still being sensitive to Moffett operations.

It was understood that Aircraft X was to climb and maintain FL190. FL190 was then programmed into the autopilot after that clearance was given. The instruments were crossed check; and autopilot was confirmed FL190 set. The aircraft was correctly climbing at 105 knots; 500 fpm; for FL190. Shortly after; departure switched Aircraft X over to Center. On initial call; it was communicated that Aircraft X was climbing out of 6;000 feet for FL210 (as that is what was filed). Center then replied that departure had given Aircraft X the wrong altitude and was to climb and maintain FL190. Aircraft X replied and confirmed FL190. Aircraft X also stated that departure had given the correct altitude of FL190; and that it was climbing for FL210 (as the flight plan was filed for FL210). This is where the communication error became apparent. Even though the autopilot was confirmed set at FL190 and that is what the pilot intended on doing; the way the statement to Center came across made them think otherwise. After that statement; Minneapolis Center gave Aircraft X a number to call. When in contact with Center on the phone the main concern to them was safety of flight. As the other Aircraft X was at FL200; when the call of 'climbing through 6000' for FL210' was made. The event ended without aircraft separation being broken. Accuracy and diligence in the phraseology to ATC is important. The Aircraft X should have initially communicated to Center 'Aircraft X (tail number) climbing out of 6;000 feet; for FL190; expecting FL210'.

During the flight; the aircraft passed in front of the sun and I lost visual contact for approx. 10 seconds. Afterwards; I could not reacquire visual contact. I could hear the propeller and executed what I estimated was a 180 degree turn with the throttle at mid-position to bring the plane back to my location. After waiting approximately the time the plane had been flying away from me; I scanned the likely area of sky but could not see it. I then executed a 90-degree banked turns to put the increase the visibility of the plane (the plane was flying in a stabilized mode with a roll limit of 90 degrees; so full aileron stick-deflection would cause a consistent 90-degree bank angle). When I was unable to see the plane (I could still hear the propeller at this point) I executed a series of turns while monitoring the RSSI (receiver signal level transmitted from the plane back to the transmitter) and tried to find a course that would increase the RSSI level indicating the plane was flying closer. Unfortunately; the RSSI telemetry system is not very accurate at this range and I was unable to get a stable enough signal. At this point the telemetry link was lost (the transmitted signal has a substantially longer range). To minimize any potential damage on landing; I closed the throttle and applied full back elevator to slow the forward speed and descent rate until I estimated the plane would have landed (approximately one minute). The primary initiation of this event was a brief loss in awareness of the plane's path relative to the sun.

We are unable to descend below 18;000 feet in that area due to our COA (Certificate of Authorization) with ATC. I believe the Controller was new to the area or unfamiliar with our UAS operations. I told the Controller that we were unable to comply with a descent below 18;000 feet. The Controller came back and told us we needed to maintain a 2500 FPM descent down to 22;000 feet and then pilot discretion to 8;000 feet. I did not comply with the clearance or start a descent as I told the Controller we were unable to descend below 18;000 feet and that we were a UAS. We are not able to descend below 18;000 feet until reaching the TFR which was about 100 miles away. Center said we were coming in broken and unreadable on the radio and I do not know if they heard us say unable. I did not want to start a descent until I had clarification from ATC about the clearance. ATC communicated to the other aircraft that was going to be a conflict that they needed to level off but the other aircraft was not able to understand ATC. I could tell the urgency in the Controller's voice when he told us we needed to start a 2500 FPM descent. I do not remember him ever saying immediately at anytime but I wanted to avoid a possible traffic conflict; so I manually took control and started an aggressive descent. The MQ9 is capable of a fast descent while under manual control but it increases workload dramatically and takes a little time to establish a fast descent. I was passing 25;500 feet when the Controller told us to maintain 26;000 feet if we had not started our descent. I told him we were descending and he asked us our descent rate. I was just passing 1500 FPM and reported it and he told us we were in violation of the clearance. I did not respond at this point due to radio delay and ATC not understanding us and focused on flying the aircraft. Once I was established in a steady descent; I had my [Second Officer] switch us to comm 2 and told ATC that we were descending to FL180 but unable to descend lower. ATC told us to maintain FL180 and proceed direct to ZZZ. I turned the aircraft towards ZZZ but due to the previous vectoring I did not have a new op mission set up yet and did not have time as I was still hand flying the MQ9 thought the level off at FL180. ATC told us that we were 10 degrees left of course and I turned right for a more direct route. After reestablishing all hold modes and changing the Emergency mission I got a mission set up to take us direct back to ZZZ. About 40 minutes later Center again told us to descend below 18;000 feet and again I had to again tell them unable. During the incident; myself and the [Second Officer] were extremely confused by Centers instructions as the Controller changed the clearance four if not five times every time they gave it. I did not want to start a descent until I had clarification on the clearance. I never once heard the Controller use the word immediately in the descent clearance and if he would have I would have complied immediately. As UAS operations become more numerous in the US; Controllers need to understand the limitations of UAS. There are delays with radio reception and transmission and UAS are not able to comply as fast as manned aircraft. In this situation; ATC would have been better off telling us to immediately descend if it was that urgent and I should have had my [Second Officer] switch to Com 2 as soon as we realized Center was having trouble understanding and tell ATC 'unable' loud and clear when they give us a clearance we cannot comply with instead wasting time trying to clarify.",,,,"A UAS pilot reported ATC issued confusing control instructions including a descent clearance below 18;000 feet even though the aircraft was not authorized to fly below 18;000 feet.",

Unfortunately; the property was almost inaccessible due to very dense vegetation and rocky paths around it. Consequently; we determined that the side of the road was good enough to set the ground base station and run the operations from there. We also made sure that there were no obstacles that could cause us losing the aircraft from line of sight. The weather was sunny with clear skies and the winds were calm. The assigned Pilot in Command was me but I was not the operator of the aircraft. Everything was set to run operations under the FAA Part 107 rules. The crew went through all the procedures to get the aircraft ready for flight; from visual inspection of the components to software system check; while I was thoroughly supervising every step. The mission was to fly autonomously over a specified terrain in a grid pattern; the way points were set on the ground station computer and successfully loaded into the aircraft's autopilot. After testing the control surfaces and motor health; and double-checking a good connection of the aircraft with the remote control; I gave the green light for the execution of the flight. The operator manually took off and flew the initial climb of the flight at full throttle. Once the operator saw that the plane was at a safe altitude for the autonomous mission to start; the operator switched to auto mode while failing to notice that the max throttle was still set. In the next 3 seconds; the operator relaxed his attention and failed to notice the aircraft deviating from the expected flight path. I saw that the plane started to bank to the right and began losing altitude rapidly. I notified the operator of the deviation; but he was unsure how to react. I was close enough to the operator for me to try to correct the deviation by reducing the throttle; which I did but it was too late. The plane was already diving head on to the ground and lost almost all its altitude; and we couldn't do anything else to save it other than killing the motor. The plane crashed not very far from the base station site; it was easily found and recovered. The plane suffered heavy damage to the point that it was not flyable. No collateral damage was found at the crash site.The autopilot was recovered from the plane and I got access to the SD card; in which the log of the flight was saved. The autopilot data showed that all internal components; such as the GPS; pitot tube; radio receiver and power module were within normal range during the short flight. A thorough analysis revealed that both GPS and pitot tube were reading extremely high airspeeds right before the plane went out of control; over 30m/s. The plane is cruise speed is rated at 16m/s; meaning that the plane was going more than double its cruise speed. Given that the plane is a flying wing with unstable yaw tendencies; I believe these tendencies were exacerbated at high speeds and a minor drag differential between the two wings was magnified. This caused the plane to bank and dive in. The autopilot's log also shows that it actually tried to correct this; however because the plane is made out of foam; the control surfaces might have flexed at high speeds; reducing their effectiveness to compensate. The probable cause of the incident was that the operator failed to reduce the throttle before switching to auto mode. A contributing factor was the operator's inexperience in reacting to unexpected situations during the mode transition. Some preventative actions are disable the manual throttle set point feature for the auto mode. This would give the autopilot full throttle control; which would have reduced the airspeed right after switching to auto mode from manual mode. If the manual throttle set point is necessary and is kept enabled; then include a verbal confirmation of proper throttle position by the operator before switching to auto mode. After the verbal confirmation; also have the pilot in command verify and approve the switch. Emphasize the operator to constantly pay attention and be prepared for unexpected aircraft behavior; in particular during flight mode transitions.",,,,"A drone operator reported their student lost control of the drone and it crashed.",

The aircraft had indicated that could maintain radio communications throughout his mission profile so elected to keep him on my frequency for a little longer. I asked the pilot if he was only going to climb to 095 as published in the profile. He replied affirmative. Prior to reaching point 9 on the route; I terminated radar services with the Aircraft X and Z flight; instructing them to remain on their current beacon codes and to advise me when they were inbound back to EFD airport. I later briefed the relieving controller of the situation and didn't think anything of it. The next day I was told that the Aircraft X had climbed as high as FL280 and at some point came in close proximity to Aircraft Y on departure. The chase plane had remained below 095 as published. Apparently the UAS operators from EFD had forwarded their weekly schedule to both Houston TRACON and Center. The schedule reflected the climb to flight levels on the appropriate day and time. The schedule was disseminated to the Front Line Supervisors; however the Controllers at the position were never briefed by the Supervisor that the altitudes would be non-standard. Better dissemination of information to the actual Controllers working the operation by both management and by the operator while on frequency.

The rest of our crew consisted of a UAS operator and two ground station operators monitoring research data collected by the UAS and UAS altitude and airspeed data. The flight was conducted under part 91; with a certificate of authorization to operate up to 5000 feet. The standard flight profile for our operations with this unmanned aircraft consists of a stepped climb up to 6200 feet; and then a constant descent to land. Equipment on board the aircraft measures atmospheric parameters such as CO2 levels; temperature; relative humidity; and wind speed and direction throughout the profile. On the incident flight; we flew a different profile; consisting of a constant climb up to 6200 feet; and a stepped descent down. The takeoff and initial climb proceeded normally. As the aircraft climbed through approximately 3700 feet; we observed a long plume of white smoke start emitting from the aircraft. The emission lasted for approximately two seconds. The aircraft immediately lost engine power; but the control surfaces were still functional. The operator was able to glide the aircraft to a landing without further incident. The smoke plume was caused by the aircraft's electronic speed controller (ESC) burning out. There was no visible damage to the outside of the ESC; but we inferred there is significant internal damage as it was no longer functional after the incident. There was no damage to the battery or to the airframe. There were no injuries and no damage to property on the ground. Immediately after landing; I reported the incident to the NTSB Response Operations center telephone line. I believe the incident was caused by the prolonged climb which may have overheated the ESC; or possibly by use of an ESC with an incorrect amperage rating. As a corrective action; we may have to adjust the profile to avoid such prolonged climbs in the future. We could also reposition the ESC in a location which receives more cooling airflow.",,,,"A UAV Pilot in Command not flying reported the UAV lost power and was glided to a landing.",

I assumed authorization of an LAANC request without verifying a text authorization was received.2. A one minute miscalculation caused the LAANC rejection of flying at night. Sunset was at XA:23. Thirty minutes past sunset was XA:53. The request was submitted at XA:09 for a 45 minute flight which puts the request end time at XA:54; one minute past the 30 minute window following sunset.How it was discovered:After the flight I realized I had failed to check for a text message with authorization before takeoff. I found no text message on my phone. I even tried and failed to find a place to view my LAANC request history online to ensure the request had been authorized. In the AirMap app used to make the request; I found the rejected LAANC request in the Flights menu area. Not an area I normally review prior to a flight because it always appeared empty. I thought maybe a bug in the AirMap app or I just didn't understand the purpose of the section. Now I know; after some experimentation; it takes my app a great many seconds to populate Flights. While it loads data the AirMap app displays the message 'no current flights.' I assumed this meant it only displayed currently active flights. Wrong assumption. If you wait long enough it loads all your past requests. And that is how I found the rejection with the reason of flying at night right at the top of the list.Contributing Factors:Fatigue and rushing. Sunset nearing; losing the light. Soon people would be nearby and I did not want to risk flying over them. The scenario made me anxious and nervous and caused me to rush.It had been 3 months since my last LAANC request so I was out of practice using the app.My Conclusions:1. I should have recognized I was rushing and fatigued and slowed myself down or stopped altogether.2. I should have waited until I positively laid eyeballs on a text authorization and known exactly where to find the request status in the app if the text message is not received. Now I do; it's in the Flights menu.3. Had I discovered the rejection I could have easily re-entered with a reduced amount of time. The request would probably have been approved without issue. Of course there could still be other conditions that would cause a flight to be rejected.4. Reviewing AirMap operation; I believe I simply missed or misread the AirMap messages warning that my submission would be rejected. I believe now that I incorrectly pressed continue rather than cancel when asked if I want to continue the flight. This is why the flight timer started and I assumed an approved flight. Poor assumption.Remediations:Training. I have reviewed the AirMap app and believe I understand where my errors occurred and why. I will also look for a detailed training for the AirMap app to see if there are other information and safety features I am unaware of to prevent any future incidents. Authorize flight in advance when possible rather than at the scene immediately before the mission. This allows the request in a neutral environment and time for reflection and adjustment. I did not know until now how to authorize a flight in advance in AirMap. Moving forward I will use that feature.Self-evaluate for fatigue; nervousness or anxiety; etc before flight. Adjust pre-flight procedures. 1. Do not rush. 2. Self evaluate mental state (How are you feeling - BE HONEST). 3. Double check all LAANC request input parameters. READ all AirMap app prompts thoroughly.4. Submit LAANC request. 5. Verify LAANC authorization received in text message and in AirMap Flights menu section. 6. Unpack drone equipment. 7. Perform pre-flight equipment checks.",,,,"UAV pilot reported flying and not realizing authorization had been denied.",

Up to the point of the accident; the flight lasted for about 45 minutes (approximate) with no system anomalies noted. Location of the GCS was on the center infield at ZZZ. The operation was within line of sight involving the remote pilot at the GCS; a sensor operator sitting next to the remote pilot; and three visual spotters looking at the aircraft. The first indication that an onboard system malfunction had occurred was that the camera sensor stopped working. This was closely followed by one of the spotters telling the remote pilot that the aircraft appeared to be descending. The UAV autopilot was no longer responsive to the active orbit over the cornfield inside the ZZZ area and the aircraft descended to the point of impact in a driveway. Minor ground damage; occurred during the post-crash fire.The exact cause of the loss is not clear at this time but appears to be consistent with total onboard electrical system failure. The flight was conducted in strict conformance with the manufacturer checklist and Certificate of Waiver or Authorization. The flight was conducted using waypoint orbits over the airport property coupled to the autopilot. No anomalous annunciations were indicated at the Ground Control Station prior to the aircraft becoming unresponsive.According to the Manufacturer; Aircraft X has only one main electrical bus. All electrical consumers; including the autopilot; are connected onto that bus that is driven by a single voltage regulator. Aircraft Y; according to the manufacturer; has multiple; independent electrical buses which would reduce the probability of total electrical loss to the avionics.",,,,"Remote pilot reported a complete loss of control of UAV due to electrical failure.",

It was reported the missing child with diminished intelligence was barefoot and without a coat. Sources felt the male teenager would likely find a spot and hide. The outside air temperature at the time of the search was about 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The subject was last seen around the neighborhood pool complex; which was located a couple of blocks away from the child's residence. The neighborhood was a tight network of townhomes. I decided the better landing zone (LZ) would be in the pool complex parking lot or on the wider open street next to it. After relocating and establishing the LZ; I readied the aircraft for flight. The top and bottoms strobes were turned on; blades attached; and the aircraft was powered up. There were no error messages except for an SD card error on the visual camera. Since it was night; there was going to be little need for the visual camera. I determined to launch with that error. The thermal camera was set for White Hot ISO with isotherms turned on for people search. The thermal and visual cameras operated normally. I went to approximately 240 feet AGL and made a 360 degree turn with the thermal camera at 0 degrees to see if any obstructions could be identified. None were identified; so I selected that as my search altitude. I began a loose grid search with [ ] looking over my shoulder at the screen to assist in spotting possible targets. The normal targets alerted; including sewer covers; electric transformers; street lights; and many heat pumps located behind homes. [ ] went to examine the back of one row of townhomes that had a different target. He reported back it was more HVAC units generating heat signatures. When the first battery was down to 20% flight time; I began to head back to the LZ to change batteries. [ ] changed the batteries to another fully charged TB55 set. I launched again and went to an altitude of 240 feet AGL and began a grid search across the area. There were times towards the edge of the grid search where I lost sight of the aircraft; but I continued the search because this was a missing disadvantaged child. Since there were no people spotted below; I felt the risk to people on the ground was minimal. I accepted the risk for the flight and continued. Approximately six minutes into the second flight; the aircraft showed about 18 minutes of flight time remaining. I observed I had lost control of the thermal camera gimbal and could not move it from a 55 degree down angle.  I was at the furthermost most point on one of the grid arms and hovering over a possible target I was going to have visually examined. I felt that the target may have been a street light with the head of the light under or in the trees but it may have also been a person sitting under a tree. Without warning the aircraft gave me a battery voltage error and a statement it was landing immediately. I was unable to keep the aircraft in the air; and the most I could do was guide the aircraft to a Final Termination Point (FTP) and get the aircraft to the ground without injuring anyone. Without the ability to move the thermal camera; I was left with few options. I could see what might have been an open field in front of me with some trees nearby. There was what appeared to be one of the primary streets into the neighborhood in front of me; but I had no idea of any traffic approaching on that road or trees below me. I turned to the left and spotted one of the townhome parking lots that was a dead end. I attempted to keep the aircraft in the air to look for any other FTPs; but the aircraft continued descending; and I received a message that it only had seconds of flight time remaining. I decided to put the aircraft down in the townhome parking area and began directionally controlling the aircraft during an uncontrolled descent to what I felt was a safe landing area considering I had no camera gimbal control. Police Department officers on the scene said the aircraft passed close over the roof of one row of townhomes and landed in the center of the dead-end street.",,,,"DJI Matrice 210 pilot reported landing the UA with only minutes to spare due to a mechanical issue and loss of power.",

I began to plan to give right of way and began to bring my UAS to my position east of the possible conflict area. I initiated RTH (return). The UAS returned to my position without incident. The helicopter continued to a hillside about 1/2 mile away and made an off-field landing next to a cell tower. I assume it was doing an inspection of the tower. It then took off again in about 15 minutes and continued south along the mountains. I ceased my flight operations with the UAS.

The toy drone I was using at the time weighed less then what is required to register (less than 55lbs) and did not fly more than +-50 feet AGL for very short test flights of a minute or less but its operation was within the Class C airspace boundary as later seen on a Sectional Chart. Looking to learn from this oversight; and as a Part 61 pilot; the incident led me to complete the course on the FAA Wings site 'Part 107 Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (small UAS)'. Following completion of the course my application for a Remote Pilot Certificate was signed by a local flight instructor and I was given a temporary Remote Pilot Certificate.

As a Part 107 and a Part 61 pilot based at ZZZ; I am familiar with airport operations; layout; and traffic patterns and was careful to avoid all safety conflicts and not violate 107.37 or 107.43. Runway XX was the runway currently in use and left traffic for that runway was well away from where I was flying; with the exception for one helicopter in the pattern flying right traffic; which overflies the building I was photographing.The helicopter traffic is at 500 feet AGL in that pattern; and I was doing my drone operation generally under 100 feet AGL; and at the absolute maximum I was at 180 feet AGL roughly. The company hangar is in front of the building I was photographing and while flying I heard their helicopter spooling up; and not knowing which way they may turn when they took off from their hangar; I landed the drone and waited until after they departed before flying again. Once I was back in the air; a company employee on the ground called the helicopter in the pattern to tell them 'some guy is flying a drone' over the building. I was operating with lights on my truck from inside the airport perimeter fence and at no point did the company employee approach me to ask who I was. After their exchange I got on the radio to clarify my operations and eliminate any concern to the helicopter pilots. Once I was done with my flight I made a radio call that I was on the ground and that drone operations were completed. I was later informed that company had been sending around a photo of me to airport tenants trying to figure out who I was.After the helicopter landed I called the pilot to apologize if it had caused any concern and he assured me that no safety concern was present to him at any time. I then called the airport manager (who was offsite) to mention what had happened so that she would be aware in case anything came up. She spoke to company and informed me that the miscommunication was all squared away; and that in retrospect; a NOTAM should be filed next time.

Aircraft X exited R-XXXX on the green route; with Aircraft Y in trail; without establishing communications and approval with FAI approach. The controller attempted different frequencies; MAINS; STBYs; RTR's; and even guard calls with no success. Finally; the controller had to call FBK ATCT to request the call sign of the chase aircraft. The controller was successful in reaching the chase aircraft and had the chase aircraft relay to Aircraft X to contact approach. By the time communication was established; Aircraft X was 8.59 miles outside of R-XXXX; inbound to FBK on the green route. Follow the COA / LOA; or update it with more current operations since it is over 2 years old.",,,,"ATC reported a loss of communication with a UAV and its chase aircraft.",

Normal pre-flight operations; but once crew got link with the aircraft; the chiefs loaded new DLI keys onto the plane without telling any of the aircrew about the new procedures.  This caused over an hour of trouble shooting in order to establish link with the aircraft.  The GCS maintenance guys reloaded the DLI keys into the GCS; but the crew was still unable to establish link with the aircraft again. Aircrew had seen some abnormal readings from the GCS about the aircraft being at [Altitude] when the crew had no link with the aircraft; same with the RPM (108.7) and Uplink sig 1 (112.4%).  The Maintenance crews were able to finally get the correct DLI keys loaded into the aircraft.  Aircrew completed all checklists up to the C-band link test.  At that point the RX2 when checked would send the aircraft lost link.  Aircrew had maintenance swap to a new GDT; which fixed the problem and the C-band link check completed fine.Crew completed the rest of the launch procedures without any problems.  During the taxi out to Runway XX; aircrew started getting  'LOS UPLINK Secondary - LOST' warning.  There were no indications of anything being wrong with the link.  Crew kept an eye on the systems to make sure there wasn't any problems with any of the links.  At the time there was nothing showing that there was anything wrong.Aircrew was cleared to line up and wait on Runway XX.  Once the crew lined up and waited the aircrew got the same warning as before.  The warning did clear; so once the aircrew got clearance to take up the crew did.  Right after the 50 kt. call; the warning came back up.  Pilot decided to continue the take off; but shortly after that; the primary uplink was lost. Sensor called out lost link.  Pilot aborted; sensor responded with abort; abort; abort.  Shortly after sensor reminded the pilot to match settings just in case the aircraft did get airborne.  During this time the crew still had no control of the aircraft.  Aircraft departed the prepared surface.  Aircraft came to a stop after Taxiway X with engine off.",,,,"UAV pilot reported the primary uplink was lost causing a remotely controlled aircraft to suffer a runway excursion during takeoff.",

Ultra frequent downward camera checks were made to confirm my position with respect to roads and walkway and that there were no underlying cars. Pedestrians were not seen at all. No incidents or accidents occurred. Flight terminated with normal landing. After flight; I was approached by an individual who later identified himself as a pilot. He appeared quite agitated and aggressive causing me concern about where the conversation would be heading and whether it would be civil. He was requesting citation of regulations with respect to how close I was permitted to fly to a vehicle. He later indicated that I was flying or hovering over or near his vehicle. He was not specific about the details. Although aerial footage was not taken for 100% of the flight; I was able to review the footage that was taken. My review indicated that I had been successful in avoiding flying over vehicles (stationary or moving) for all but two short portions of the flights. With respect to those two periods; the video is not conclusive because of the angle of the camera. I don't know where the individual's vehicle was so I don't know if there was a different time that he may have been referring to. If the individual was right; my diligence and awareness of the requirement not to fly over vehicles ultimately may not have prevented flight over vehicles. I will need to plan even more intently before the UAS leaves the ground how to prevent flight over vehicles. Changing takeoff and landing locations and/or filming locations may be necessary to reduce the possibility of flight over vehicles.",,,,"UAV pilot reported he was approached by an individual concerned that the UAV had been operated over his vehicle.",

After realizing that I had not written down the authorization on my work order I immediately discontinued the flight and landed the drone. I then tried to obtain the automated approval through the Airmap application. Per the Airmap application; approvals up to 400 feet could be obtained; however; the application stated that the approval was not available on an automated basis at that time. Flight was discontinued. The max height the drone climbed to was 110 feet without approval for a period less than a couple of minutes. Pilot error was not obtaining approval before flight. The pilot thought the approval was already obtained which was the reason the drone flight was started. Future corrective action is to include the approval verification in the preflight checklist.",,,,"UAV pilot reported pilot error in not obtaining authorization for the flight.",
