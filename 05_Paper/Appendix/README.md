# Paper Supplementary Materials - UAV Enhancement Patterns

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains detailed supplementary materials for the research paper:

**"UAV Accident Forensics using HFACS and Large Language Models"**

## 📁 Contents

### `UAV_Enhancement_Patterns_Complete.md`
Complete documentation containing:

- **26 UAV Enhancement Patterns** organized by HFACS levels
- **Detailed pattern definitions** with sources and indicators
- **HFACS category mappings** for each pattern
- **5 Theoretical categories** grouping related patterns
- **Complete validation statistics** and methodology

## 🎯 Purpose

This appendix provides the complete documentation of UAV-specific enhancement patterns that extend the traditional HFACS framework for unmanned aircraft systems. The patterns were systematically derived through:

1. **Literature Review**: 56 peer-reviewed papers (2010-2025)
2. **Incident Analysis**: 847 ASRS UAV incident reports (2016-2023)
3. **Regulatory Analysis**: FAA Part 107, EASA, ICAO frameworks
4. **Expert Validation**: 5 domain experts (7-15 years experience)
5. **Statistical Validation**: Cohen's κ = 0.82, CFI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.06

## 📊 Pattern Distribution

| **HFACS Level** | **Patterns** | **Focus Area** |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| **L4: Organizational** | 6 patterns | Policy, resources, compliance |
| **L3: Supervision** | 5 patterns | Training, oversight, procedures |
| **L2: Preconditions** | 11 patterns | Technology, environment, awareness |
| **L1: Unsafe Acts** | 4 patterns | Skill errors, perceptual errors |

## 🔗 Theoretical Categories

The 26 patterns are organized into 5 theoretical categories:

1. **Remote Operation Challenges** (6 patterns)
2. **Automation Complexity** (5 patterns)
3. **Communication Dependencies** (4 patterns)
4. **Regulatory Considerations** (6 patterns)
5. **Power System Limitations** (5 patterns)

## 📖 Usage
