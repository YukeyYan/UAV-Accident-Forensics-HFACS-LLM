\section{UAV Enhancement Patterns}
\label{appendix:uav_patterns}

This study identified and validated 26 UAV-specific enhancement patterns that extend the traditional HFACS framework for unmanned aircraft systems. The patterns are organized across four HFACS hierarchical levels: Level 4 (Organizational Influences, 6 patterns), Level 3 (Unsafe Supervision, 5 patterns), Level 2 (Preconditions for Unsafe Acts, 11 patterns), and Level 1 (Unsafe Acts, 4 patterns). Additionally, the patterns are grouped into five theoretical categories: Remote Operation Challenges, Automation Complexity, Communication Dependencies, Regulatory Considerations, and Power System Limitations.

The complete documentation of all 26 patterns, including detailed definitions, data sources, key indicators, HFACS mappings, validation statistics, and theoretical categorization, is available in the project repository at:

\texttt{https://github.com/YukeyYan/UAV-Accident-Forensics-HFACS-LLM/tree/master/05\_Paper/Appendix}

The patterns were systematically derived through literature review of 56 peer-reviewed papers (2010-2025), analysis of 847 ASRS UAV incident reports (2016-2023), regulatory framework analysis, and validation by 5 domain experts with 7-15 years of experience. Statistical validation achieved Cohen's $\kappa = 0.82$, CFI = 0.94, and RMSEA = 0.06.
