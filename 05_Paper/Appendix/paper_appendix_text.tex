\section{UAV Enhancement Patterns}
\label{appendix:uav_patterns}

This study identified 26 UAV-specific enhancement patterns extending the HFACS framework, organized across four hierarchical levels: L4 Organizational (6 patterns), L3 Supervision (5 patterns), L2 Preconditions (11 patterns), and L1 Unsafe Acts (4 patterns). The patterns were derived through literature review (56 papers, 2010-2025), ASRS incident analysis (847 reports), and expert validation (Cohen's $\kappa = 0.82$).

Complete pattern documentation, including definitions, sources, indicators, and HFACS mappings, is available at:
