### 🚀 Usage Examples

#### Loading the Dataset
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the ground truth dataset
df = pd.read_csv('01_Data/Ground_Truth/ground_truth_standard_coded.csv')

print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Number of incidents: {len(df)}")
print(f"Number of features: {len(df.columns)}")
```

#### Analyzing HFACS Categories
```python
# Extract HFACS presence indicators
hfacs_categories = [col for col in df.columns if col.endswith('_Present')]

# Calculate category frequencies
category_freq = df[hfacs_categories].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
print("HFACS Category Frequencies:")
print(category_freq)
```

#### Confidence Analysis
```python
# Analyze confidence scores
confidence_cols = [col for col in df.columns if col.endswith('_Confidence')]
mean_confidence = df[confidence_cols].mean().mean()
print(f"Average confidence across all categories: {mean_confidence:.3f}")
```
